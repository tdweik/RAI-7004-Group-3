*# Machine Learning Pipeline CLI

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) application for experimenting with and developing machine learning pipelines using scikit-learn. It allows users to easily train models on datasets and evaluate their performance.

## Features

- Support for both classification and regression algorithms.
- Ability to load datasets from CSV files.
- Cross-validation for performance evaluation.
- Persistence of trained models as `.pkl` files.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

You can run the CLI application using the following command:

```
python -m src.cli <path_to_csv> <target_column> <algorithm_name> [--random_state <value>] [--num_folds <value>]
```

**Parameters:**

- `--csv`: Path to the input CSV file (required).
- `--target`: Name of the target column (required).
- `--algorithm`: Name of the algorithm to use (required). Supported algorithms:
  - Classification: `logistic_regression`, `decision_tree`, `random_forest`
  - Regression: `linear_regression`, `decision_tree_regressor`, `random_forest_regressor`
- `--random_state`: Random state for reproducibility (optional, default is None).
- `--num_folds`: Number of folds for cross-validation (optional, default is 5).

### Jupyter Notebook

You can also use the application in a Jupyter Notebook by importing the necessary modules and calling the functions directly. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
from src.pipeline import ML_Pipeline

pipeline = ML_Pipeline(csv_file='sample_house_prices.csv', target_column='price', algorithm='linear_regression')
pipeline.run()
```

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
pytest tests/
```
